<p align="center">The "Team Tracker Application" is a comprehensive desktop tool designed to facilitate project management within organizations. Developed using the Winforms Framework, this application operates locally within an organization's network, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud storage. The primary focus of the application is to streamline project tracking and task management in a hierarchical structure, ensuring confidentiality and efficiency within teams. The application boasts eight key features tailored to different roles within the organization. Project managers, team leaders, and directors have access to features such as viewing all tasks and team members' tasks on a project-by-project basis, as well as the ability to create, update, and delete tasks within their assigned projects. Team members, on the other hand, can view and update tasks assigned to them within the current project.</p>

The "Team Tracker Application" is a comprehensive desktop tool designed to facilitate project management within organizations. Developed using the Winforms Framework, this application operates locally within an organization's network, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or cloud storage. The primary focus of the application is to streamline project tracking and task management in a hierarchical structure, ensuring confidentiality and efficiency within teams. The application boasts eight key features tailored to
different roles within the organization. Project managers, team leaders, and directors have access to features such as viewing all tasks and team members' tasks on a project-by-project basis, as well as the ability to create, update, and delete tasks within their assigned projects. Team members, on the other hand, can view and update tasks assigned to them within the current project. Additionally, the application includes a dedicated panel for issue
management, allowing users to raise, update, and delete issues, fostering collaborative problem-solving among colleagues. An integrated discussion forum enables real-time communication and collaboration among team members, enhancing productivity and teamwork. To keep users informed, a notification panel delivers timely updates and alerts regarding task assignments, issue resolutions, and project developments. Furthermore, the application provides insightful reports on the status of logged-in users, presenting data on
the number of tasks completed, pending tasks, and task statuses through graphical representations.
